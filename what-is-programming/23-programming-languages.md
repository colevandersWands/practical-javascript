# Programming Languages

Programming languages have developed alongside computing hardware in order to facilitate different approaches to writing software. Sometimes these languages were constrained by the capabilities of their target hardware. Other times, these languages were tailored to specific types of calculations or algorithms in order to more easily accomplish their users' goals. This book deals primarily with JavaScript, but the following list will help you gain an understanding of some of the many types of programming languages. Please note that this list is in no way exhaustive.


## Assembly

The very first programming languages were Assembly Languages. These are "low level" languages, meaning that the developer writes instructions that are directly executed by the computing hardware. This often means that developers typed cryptic sequences of characters or otherwise indicated binary information that often corresponded directly with how the hardware worked. 

## Compiled Languages

Writing Assembly code is so arduous that developers almost instantly wished for a more expressive way to write their software. This quickly led to the development of "compiled" programming languages. The developer would write code in a "higher level" language that corresponded less to the machine instructions and more to the way humans think and speak. Those instructions were then interpreted by a compiler, which would produce a "binary" file that could be executed by the computing hardware. These languages remain popular, and new compiled languages are regularly created, because they allow for a good balance of developer experience and machine efficiency.
