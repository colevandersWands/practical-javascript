# Core Concepts in Programming

After the advent of computers, programming languages grew and proliferated. Programming languages have gone through an evolution of type and purpose, which has often coincided with the capabilities of hardware and the needs of the people using the computing devices. However, there is also an evolutionary quality to the history of programming languages. As concepts are developed they are worked through, enhanced, revised, discarded, or kept. Since there are many goals and purposes for writing software, there are many ways of doing it. 

Often, when we talk about "writing code" or "programming" we mean the act of writing instructions for the computer to follow. These instructions define different concepts and actions that the computer hardware can use to make different things happen: a pixel lights up on the screen, or a value gets written to disk. Writing the correct instructions to create our desired outcome is the challenge of coding (please note: I use the words "coding" and "programming" interchangeably since they are generally used that way in the field).

Over time, some concepts have permeated the world of programming so they exist in almost all languages. These are core concepts that make it possible to achieve different logical expressions. Using these core concepts allows us to create sets of instructions for computing hardware and to define _algorithms_ that perform specific tasks. We will review some of these core concepts below, and throughout this book we will dig more deeply into how many of these work within the JavaScript programming language. 

## Algorithms and Instructions

An **algorithm** is a "self-contained sequence of actions to be performed" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm)). Algorithms can be designed to process information, calculate a specific value, modify a digital file, or perform a sequence of actions using computer-controlled machines. This might include ingesting and annotating data received from a weather sensor, applying a filter to a photo so that it looks like it was taken by an old-time camera, calculating interest on a bank account, or controlling a mechanical arm on a factory assembly line. 

Algorithms are designed to accomplish a specific action, and a software application will often make use of several algorithms in order to deliver its full set of features. If you imagine an app like Facebook, you might recognize ways in which different algorithms are used: An algorithm governs how user authentication is handled. An algorithm modifies files that a user uploads with the app. An algorithm determines which content to show you in your news feed.

Algorithms are connected with **instructions**. Much of any software application's code is concerned with connecting discrete actions (often powered by specific _algorithms_) using sets of instructions. These instructions are what determines that, for example, when a user comes to the site they are asked to authenticate their identity. The instructions would lead the user to a page or screen where they are asked for the information they need, and then that information would be handed off to the code that comprises the _authentication algorithm_ in order to verify the user's identity. That algorithm would return a result that would then allow the app to know the user is authenticated, and other instructions would then tell the app how to behave.

It is useful to understand that as we write code we are doing different things at different times. Sometimes we are concerned with creating complex logic that performs specific tasks in an efficient manner. This practice is, often, the creation of algorithms and tends to lead to the creation of software components that can be used in many different situations.

At other times, we are writing instructions that are designed to move the user through the application, present different features to the user, and move data between all of the components of the application. This kind of coding is similar to writing algorithms, but it has different constraints and criteria for success.

In order to create either algorithms or instructions, software developers make use of a common set of concepts that exist across most programming languages. These concepts, which are built into the programming languages themselves, allow for data to be manipulated, logic to be described and enforced, and code to be interpreted by the computing hardware.

## Syntax
In all programming languages, there is a definition of "[syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_%28programming_languages%29)". The syntax of a language determines the specific way lines of code must be written. Many languages require a semicolon (`;`) to end each line. Many languages use curly braces (`{` and `}`) to denote the contents of a function or loop.

Each language has a different syntax, but they all enforce their syntax, often ruthlessly. In most programming languages, a "syntax error" will break the entire application. This is often a source of frustration for
