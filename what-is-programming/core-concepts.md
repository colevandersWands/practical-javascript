# Core Concepts in Programming

After the advent of computers, programming languages grew and proliferated. Programming languages have gone through an evolution of type and purpose, which has often coincided with the capabilities of hardware and the needs of the people using the computing devices. However, there is also an evolutionary quality to the history of programming languages. As concepts are developed they are worked through, enhanced, revised, discarded, or kept. Since there are many goals and purposes for writing software, there are many ways of doing it. 

Often, when we talk about "writing code" or "programming" we mean the act of writing instructions for the computer to follow. These instructions define different concepts and actions that the computer hardware can use to make different things happen: a pixel lights up on the screen, or a value gets written to disk. Writing the correct instructions to create our desired outcome is the challenge of coding (please note: I use the words "coding" and "programming" interchangeably since they are generally used that way in the field).
