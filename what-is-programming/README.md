#What is Programming?

Programming is an umbrella term that we use to mean all of the activities related to creating software that runs on computer hardware. That's a very general description of what programming is, but it's tough to be much more specific and also accurate. The truth is that programming is different depending on what you're trying to do. In some cases, it's extremely difficult, uses obscure markings, and is almost incomprehensible to all but the most expert humans. In other cases, programming is straightforward sets of instructions that use almost-human language to describe tasks that make sense even to people with no special training.

Mostly, programming falls somewhere between these two extremes. 

There are several activities that tend to be lumped together as "programming":

1. We **identify a problem** that we can solve with some form of computer software. These problems may be huge or tiny, but it's always necessary to start with some goal in mind.
2. We **identify a solution** we can "implement" in code. When talking about software, implementation is the process of building the code and other media assets required to make a solution work. 
3. We **write code**, create media assets, and populate datasets in order to make the software work. Each of these activities uses a different set of skills and requires precise planning.
4. We **make sure the software works** and fix the problems we find. Testing software requires a whole unique set of skills and approaches different from creating the software in the first place.
5. We **deploy** our software somewhere. In software terms, "deployment" means packaging and delivering code, media assets, and data for usage by an end user. (An "end user" is a person who wants to use the software we've created.)

This is, of course, a gross simplification of what it means to "program". In fact, each of these things could be broken out into much longer lists, detailing all the different efforts, techniques, knowledge, and learning that goes into every step of the process. We have the notion of a Software Development Lifecycle that contextualizes these steps into an ongoing process of development
