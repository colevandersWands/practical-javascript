# Coding Style

It's important to write clean code that we can return to at a later date, or which our collaborators can review, and make sense of. The more consistent we are with how we write our code, the easier it is to return to it later and make improvements or fixes. In all programming languages there is a notion of a standard style and approach that grows out of common usage patterns and design choices in the language itself. JavaScript, of course, is no different.

And just as each newspaper has a slightly customized style guide that governs its newsroom writers, each development group will have a somewhat unique take on things. With a language like JavaScript, which has grown and changed a lot in recent years, it can be especially confusing to read multiple style guides that come from different eras. It's crucial to consult updated material for the latest, best practices. A resource like the [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/rules.html) is useful, and their site contains a living guide to the latest in generally accepted JavaScript style standards.

<h2>Linters Are Awesome!</h2>
<p>A development in code editors over the past 10 years has been the rapid growth of "linters"&mdash;helper utilities that dynamically alert us to stylistic flaws or syntactical errors in our code. These can be thought of as a "grammar check" for code, and they work in similar ways. We can install a linter into our favorite editor (most editors support them) and they will usually underline, highlight, or mark in some way each line that causes either a stylistic warning or a syntactical error.</p>

<p>Linters are super helpful, especially as we are learning new languages. They make it easier to see the small syntax errors that so often cause new developers a lot of frustration, and they help us develop good habits writing code that meets stylistic guidelines. Look up linters for whatever editor you prefer. If you want to try an editor an linter combo, download the [Atom](https://atom.io) editor and install the [JavaScript Standard Style Linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter-js-standard) to give it a try.</p>
