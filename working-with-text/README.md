# Working with Text

In all software development, text is the medium. We define relationships using text, we set up sequences of instructions that are all written in text, and we store information about all the different components of our systems in text. Text rules the world of coding, and it's no surprise that working with text effectively is a major part of what we do in writing programs.

In the end, a user record is often indicated by a simple ID number. The difference between getting a pizza with mushrooms and a pizza with pepperoni is probably indicated by a simple keyword or a Boolean value on an Object. The entire state of a game like tic-tac-toe is likely contained in the software as an array of playable positions and information about the status of each one. In each of these cases, we are using abstract text and numbers to represent information that needs to be presented successfully to our users.

To present information to our users that makes sense, we must transform the values in our software into proper text that works within the context of our website or application. We must create the proper HTML structures, modify existing HTML elements, or format text with labels and identifiers. We might need to translate data values into percentages or into CSS-compatible measurements.

In order to accomplish all of these goals, there are some useful tools for working with text included in JavaScript. We will explore some of those tools in this section.
