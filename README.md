Welcome to _A Practical Introduction to JavaScript._ Thanks for reading. In order to help you get the most out of this book, it is useful to consider exactly what this book does and what it does not do. 

This book aims to teach fundamental concepts of programming using JavaScript. It assumes no background with programming languages. The goal of the book is to help novice developers learn about assembling basic programs using common approaches. It uses modern approaches to writing code, but it does not assume a familiarity with the evolution of software development that has led us to this place. 

This book is not a book written for experienced developers who wish to add another language to their repertoire. It does not push the boundaries of thinking about algorithms or demonstrate the flashiest solutions to problems. If you are looking for a quick read about the latest changes in JavaScript, then this probably isn't the book for you.

This book recognizes that programming, in general, and JavaScript, specifically, are both things that happen everywhere in our digital world: as more and more devices contain computing hardware, that hardware is always running software. Software is always powered by some form of programming.

This book also privileges programming for the Web, since that is the origin of JavaScript and still the primary place where JavaScript is used. Much of the discussion and examples will lean on Web-based scenarios and use cases.
