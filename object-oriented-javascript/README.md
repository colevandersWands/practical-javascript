# Object Oriented JavaScript

Prior to ECMAScript 6, JavaScript supported "object oriented"-like functionality, but it was difficult and clunky to emulate a real object oriented approach to writing code. For that reason, JavaScript mostly used functions and events to chain together features, which worked well enough but caused some consternation for developers used to operating in an object oriented context.

Some of the most popular languages in the world are object oriented programming languages: C++, Java, Python, Objective C, C#, etc. Although there are other popular programming paradigms, object oriented programming (often abbreviated as OOP) has been a major force in software development for several decades. It is a set of core principles and design concepts that has proven to be a useful way of thinking about information and functionality.

In this section we will learn more about OOP concepts and how we can use those concepts in our code. Keep in mind that the fundamental concepts behind OOP are not exclusive to JavaScript, so it is useful to know these concepts even beyond the realm of our browser-based code.
