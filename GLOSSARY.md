## compiled
A description of a programming language that uses a "compiler" to create an executable file.

## compiler
An application used to convert source code in a given programming language into an executable file that can be run by computing hardware. (See also: compiled.)

## dynamic
A description of a programming language that infers or determines the datatypes of variables without requiring explicit declaration.

## Ecma International
The governing body that stewards the ECMAScript standard, upon which JavaScript is based. 

## executable file
A file that can be run directly on the computing hardware without requiring any interpretation or compilation at runtime.

## interpreter
An application used to convert source code in a given programming language into machine instructions that can be executed by the computing hardware.

## iterable objects
JavaScript objects that implement the [Iterator Protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols) so they can be iterated over including Arrays, Maps, Objects, Symbols, and more. 

## linter
A tool used in a code editor to check syntax and style, usually in real-time. Most popular code editors support linting tools such as [JSHint](http://jshint.com/) and [ESLint](http://eslint.org/). Refer to the documentation in your chosen editor for more information about installing and using linters for whatever language you are writing.

## scripted
A description of a programming language that uses a runtime interpreter to convert source code into an executable file.

## source code
The code a developer types in a given programming language using some form of text editor. This code is typically either compiled into an executable file, or it is interpreted at runtime by an interpreter.

## typed
A description of a programming language that requires developers to explicitly declare the datatype of each variable they use.
