# The Document Object Model
The Document Object Model (DOM) is the conceptual model used to represent an HTML document in the browser. JavaScript has built-in functionality to inspect, read, and modify every element in an HTML document using DOM-specific tools such as `document.querySelector()` and `element.addChild()`. There are many of these tools that we will use to interact with the DOM as we write our JavaScript programs.
