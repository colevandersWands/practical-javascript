# Modifying Elements
Now that we've explored how to select and retrieve elements from the DOM, we will move on to how to modify these elements. Modifying elements in the DOM, or adding/removing elements to/from the DOM, is crucial to creating a responsive experience for users. Users expect that if they interact with a page it will change: links will light up, buttons will click down, text will change, notifications will come and go, and their actions will have an effect.

Our pages should engage the user at all times in ways that are meaningful, predictable, and regular. If a user clicks "save" there should be suitable feedback to let the user know that the item has been saved. This helps the user understand what has happened and it matches what the user anticipated would happen. The next time the user clicks "save" the same interaction should unfold. This shows regularity in the interface. 

Of course, making broad statements about how things _should_ happen on a web page is one thing. Building those features is often another matter entirely. Let's take a look at how we can begin that task.
